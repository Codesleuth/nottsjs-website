‚ö°Ô∏è This month in NottsJS is **lightning talks**! ‚ö°Ô∏è

Come along to hear from members of our community and share your thoughts or experiences! Sign up on the day to give a talk! The talks will be 5 - 10 mins each and can be either **technical** or **non-technical**. Slides are optional so don't feel you need to prepare a talk in advance!

We can't wait to see you all there ü•≥
