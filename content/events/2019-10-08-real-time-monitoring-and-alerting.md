Do you know if your last deployment slowed page load times or increased error rates of your single-page application? Discover the next frontier of front-end development by implementing real-time performance monitoring and alerting capabilities using Elasticsearch.

In this talk, Ersel will share the learnings from integrating a react based single page application with Elasticsearch at [BrightHR](https://www.brighthr.com/), an award winning SaaS solution operating in UK, Canada and Australia.

You'll learn how metrics such as page load, asset download, network call times and errors can be captured to monitor the health and performance of your front-end in real-time.
